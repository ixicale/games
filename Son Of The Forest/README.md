# Sons of the forest

This contains files to load your character with all items in game to be replaced by the original ones, its on your own risk to use this, i'm not responsible for any bans or lost progress.

Make sure to backup your save files before using this.

Win+R and paste this path to open the game save folder:

```
%APPDATA%\..\LocalLow\Endnight\SonsOfTheForest\Saves
```

Replace the files in the '/player' folder with the ones from your saved game. To recognize which one is your saved game, I recommend sorting the folders by modification date and copying the files inside the zip into the most recent saved game folder.
